# Used Car Price Analysis

## Project Overview

In this project, I analyzed a dataset from Kaggle containing information on 426K used cars. The original dataset included details on 3 million cars, but a subset was used to ensure speed of processing. The objective was to determine the factors that influence the price of a used car and to offer clear recommendations to a used car dealership regarding what consumers value in a used car.

## Project Goals

1. **Understand the factors that affect car prices:** Identify which attributes of a car (e.g., make, model, year, mileage, etc.) have the most significant impact on its price.
2. **Provide actionable recommendations:** Based on my analysis, give practical advice to the used car dealership on how to price their inventory and what aspects to highlight to attract customers.

## CRISP-DM Framework

This project followed the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology, which is a widely used framework for data analysis projects. Below is a brief overview of the CRISP-DM process:

1. **Business Understanding:** Understanding the project objectives and requirements from a business perspective, and converting this knowledge into a data mining problem definition.
2. **Data Understanding:** Collecting initial data, familiarizing with the data, identifying data quality issues, and discovering initial insights.
3. **Data Preparation:** Preparing the final dataset that will be used for analysis and modeling. This includes cleaning, transforming, and organizing data.
4. **Modeling:** Applying various modeling techniques to the prepared data and selecting the best model based on performance.
5. **Evaluation:** Evaluating the model's performance to ensure it meets the business objectives and identifying any issues or opportunities for improvement.
6. **Deployment:** Deploying the model in a real-world setting and making it available to stakeholders.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a subset of the original Kaggle dataset, containing information on 426,000 used cars. The dataset includes various attributes such as:

- Make
- Model
- Year
- Mileage
- Price
- Location
- Condition
- Features (e.g., sunroof, leather seats, etc.)

## Tools and Technologies

The project was conducted using the following tools and technologies:

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Data Analysis and Visualization:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn
- **IDE:** Jupyter Notebook or any other preferred Python IDE

## Steps to Get Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/used-car-price-analysis.git
    cd used-car-price-analysis
    ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the analysis:**
    Open the Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells to perform the data analysis and modeling.

## Deliverables

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** A thorough exploration of the dataset to understand the distribution of data, identify patterns, and detect any anomalies.
2. **Modeling Results:** The outcomes of different modeling techniques applied to the dataset, along with their evaluation metrics.
3. **Recommendations Report:** A detailed report providing actionable recommendations to the used car dealership based on the analysis.

## Conclusion

By completing this project, I gained insights into what factors influence the price of used cars and provided valuable recommendations to a used car dealership. This analysis will help the dealership make informed decisions on pricing and marketing their inventory to meet consumer demands.
